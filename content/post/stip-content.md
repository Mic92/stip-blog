Today I learned that my calorie-tracking app thinks that I eat fewer calories on
days I eat pizza than on days I don't. Unfortunately I think this is a due to a
lack of data (it's only basing this off of about 11 days of tracking). Even if
it were true, correlation isn't causation. Still, I won't turn down an excuse to
eat more pizza.
